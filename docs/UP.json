Briefing reporters on the Covid situation, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that India has 89.51 per cent people who have been cured of Covid-19 infection, 1.25 per cent deaths related to the viral infection and 9.24 per cent active cases. \"If we look at new cases, we will find that the previous highest surge has already been crossed and the trend is going upward. That is a cause for worry,\" said Bhushan. The health secretary said the situation in Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh is concerning as both the states are witnessing a major spike in infections. \"The weekly positivity rate in Chhattisgarh has increased from one-and-a-half percent to 27.9 per cent. \"Chhattisgarh was reporting hardly 200 cases per day in mid-February, but today it reported 11,504 cases. The average test per million has increased but has not kept pace with the change in case. The average daily RT-PCR share is roughly 28-30 per cent and ramping up of test capacity is needed,\" he said. Talking about Uttar Pradesh, the health secretary said that on average 89 cases a day were reported in the state, but now it has increased to 10,000. \"The average daily RT-PCR tests are around 45 to 44 per cent, so they also need to be ramped up. The weekly positivity is 4.84 per cent but it is showing a rising trend,\" he said.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/news/covid-19-chhattisgarh-uttar-pradesh-states-of-concern-says-union-health-secretary-rajesh-bhushan/videoshow/82052133.cms","image":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-82052133,imgsize-142295.cms","publishedOn":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 14:03:35 GMT","publisher":{"name":"Times of India","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com","icon":"https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-ipad-retina-precomposed.png","twitter":null,"facebook":"26781952138"}},{"title":"Uttar Pradesh govt spreading false propaganda on controlling COVID-19: Akhilesh Yadav","description":"\"There is a crisis in UP caused by corona.
